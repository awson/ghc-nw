<h3>General Information</h3>

<p>
This is the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc">GHC</a> 8.2.2+ 64-bit Windows distro,
based on and targeting Microsoft Visual C runtime and native Windows SDK
(unlike the official distro based on mingw-w64 runtime/sdk).
</p>

<p>
The code it produces is statically linkable with native Microsoft Visual C
and Windows SDK libraries. Dynamic CRT only is supported at the moment (though
static CRT support could be added if wanted by many).
</p>

<p>
Supplied are 2 variants of the distribution: for Visual Studio 2013 (12),
and for Visual Studio 2017/2015 (15/14).
</p>

<p>
Only VS 2013 and 2017 are tested, but 2015 should also work. Visual C runtimes
12 and 14 are incompatible, hence these 2 variants.
</p>

<p>
Also, VS 2013 variant might work against earlier versions, but this is a
speculation, I never tested this.
</p>

<p>
There exist 2 versions of each distro: <q>core</q> (GHC + alex/cabal/happy/hscolour)
and <q>full</q>, which also contains a (large) set of prebuilt packages from Hackage.
</p>

<p>
In particular, <code>yesod</code> and <code>opaleye</code> packages are included, since I'm aware
some users had problems with them on stock GHC distribution.

<h3>Some Technical Details</h3>

<p>
We provide NO SOURCES at the moment except the patches from this project, and
the patch to binutils (included in the distro archives).
</p>

<p>
GHC itself is heavily modified. I'll try to release the patches which generally
improve GHC and could be incorporated into the main GHC codebase. I have
neither time nor energy to clean up and release most of MSVC-specific
patches though.
</p>

<p>
This distro is based on (and includes) <em>modified</em> LLVM tools (clang, lld
and llvm-lib). Distro <em>won't work at all</em> on vanilla versions of these tools.
