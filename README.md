# ghc-nw
This is a supplementary project to support [Visual C/Windows SDK compatible GHC distribution ("GHC NW")](https://awson.github.io/ghc-nw).

Please, use this project's issue tracker for any feedback.

The "full" distribution contains a large set of prebuilt haskell packages. Patches to apply for successful build are collected here -- both [the patches ready to be upstreamed](patches_clean), and [quick and dirty patches suitable for GHC NW build only at the moment](patches_dirty).
